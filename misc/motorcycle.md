# Motorcycle?

## TL;DR

Motorcycles are not an effective general solution to transportation. They can in
some cases be an effective auxiliary transportation tool, and they can be a hell
of toy, albeit an expensive one.

## Objective

The purpose of this document is to lay out the advantages and disadvantages of a
motorcycle and to derive from that when it does and does not make sense to
acquire and maintain one, primarily for our own reference the next time we're
bitten by the idea that maybe one would make sense.

## Motorcycles as Transit

For better or worse[^1], cars are the de facto standard transit solution for
most Americans, so we will use them as our baseline for evaluating the
desirability of motorcycles from a purely utilitarian perspective.

### Comparison

We'll start with the advantages that motorcycles enjoy over cars:

1. Reduced capital expenditure. The sticker on a low-end, highway-capable bike
   like Honda's CB300R should sit around 5k USD. The MSRP on a Honda Civic,
   meanwhile, will be in the range of 20-25k USD. Of course, we also need to
   factor in the cost of riding gear to the motorcycle, but even with this the
   initial investment remains considerably lower.
1. Lane splitting. *Assuming* lane splitting is permitted where you live (at
   time of writing, CA is the only US state that explicitly permits it), and you
   live in an area prone to traffic congestion, then the option of splitting
   lanes can provide considerable time savings on a commute.
1. Easy parking. Bikes are smaller than cars. In places with limited street parking,
   this can be a meaningful advantage.

Next, things that are a bit of a toss-up, or depend on specific context:

1. Operational expenditure. Motorcycle maintenance schedules are more aggressive
   than for cars, most notably tires. But, these maintenance operations tend to
   be cheaper than their more spaced-out equivalents for cars, so conventional
   wisdom is it's a bit of a wash. More importantly, motorcycle insurance can be
   quite expensive or relativelty inexpensive. Most of the liability from
   operating a motorcycle is to the rider's life and limb, so if you are
   comfortable riding with limited injury coverage (and you are legally allowed
   to do so), then the cost of the motorcycle insurance may be low. Otherwise,
   it can be quite substantial.
   
And last, places where a bike falls down:

1. Personal hazard. By the numbers, motorcycles are [massively more
   dangerous](https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/Publication/813112)
   than cars. This can be mitigated via religious use of protective gear and
   avoidance of impairments while riding, but the fundamental fact remains that
   motorcyclists are more vulnerable, less visible, and operating a more
   volatile machine than their car-bound peers.
1. Attention requirements. Cars take care of a lot of things for you. They have
   a wide base and a low center of gravity, so you don't have to think about
   balance. They have an abundance of traction, so you don't have to worry about
   braking inside of a turn. They almost always run on an automatic transmission
   these days, so you don't have to think about popping a clutch in and out and
   matching engine speed to road speed. This is in contrast to a bike, where all
   of these things have to be handled by the operator, and what's more, the
   consequences of screwing it up tend to be more severe than in a car. The end
   result of this is a different bar for what constitutes impairment. It's a bad
   idea to drive if you've had a few drinks. It's a bad idea to ride if you've
   had a long, hard day. If one is looking to safely operate a motorcycle as a
   commuting device, that's a *serious* drawback.
1. Cargo and Convenience. Motorcycles have very limited cargo capacities
   compared to cars, even with saddlebags attached. This makes running an errand
   like grabbing a large load of groceries... challenging. Additionally,
   motorcycles require you to wear a considerable amount of gear if you are
   going to operate them safely. There is a fair bit of "incognito" gear on the
   market which can double as street-wear reasonably well, but depending on what
   activities you're doing at your destinatipm, you may still find yourself
   changing into and out of your riding clothes to go to and from, and needing
   to find a place to store it while. This is possibly a problem and probably at
   least a nuisance.
1. Environmental externalities. Motorcycles, being very light, tend to burn
   relatively little gasoline per mile. Going back to the CB300R/Civic
   comparison, and using their EPA estimates
   ([CB300R](https://powersports.honda.com/street/sport/cbr300r/specifications?year=2021),
   [Civic](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/noframes/43356.shtml)) for mileage,
   we expect to burn about 1.4 gallons of gasoline to move the bike 100 miles,
   but will spend just under twice that, ~2.8 gallons, to move the
   car. Additionally, the motorcycle is simply less to manufacture and
   transport, so the CO2 cost to "birth" the bike should be lower as
   well. Things look good for the bike, but closer analysis shows a serious
   problem in two parts. First, there are local environmental concerns that
   deserve consideration, and which have nothing to do with CO2 emissions. This
   is the "every kid who grew up in LA east of I-405 has asthma" problem, and
   the exhaust out of a bike is much worse in this arena than what comes out of
   a car. Second, CO2 is far from the only molecule that can exhibit greenhouse
   behavior. Unfortunately for motorcycles, their exhaust is also chock full of
   more potent greenhouse gases, to the point where their exhaust's
   GHG-equivalent [can easily be
   worse](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10347012122338531296&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5)
   than a car's. A small silver lining for motorcycles: if and when electric
   motorcycles become mainstream, their inefficient exhaust-cleaning stops being
   an issue and they come out on top again.
   
### Verdict

The challenges outlined in the previous section, especially the lack of cargo
space and the attention requirements necessary to safely operate a motorcycle,
suggest to us that a motorcycle is a poor 100% transit solution. In many cases,
that simply means that a motorcycle doesn't make sense as a transit solution at
all (if you need to buy a car in addition to your bike you've lost most of the
advantage of the bike). Nevertheless, there do exist circumstances where adding
a motorcycle (or scooter) to a transportation portfolio may make practical
sense. For instance, if you are married and already have one car between you,
and just need a second vehicle so both of you can commute to work in the
morning.

## Motorcycles as Toys

Now, many people own and operate motorcycles not because they're practical, but
because they're *fun*. It must be recognized that these are expensive toys, but
if we compare them to their natural competitor, the sports car[^2], they almost
dominate.

### Comparison

First, areas of advantage for motorcycles:

1. Price. A new Suzuki Hayabusa can be had for ~20k USD, while you're not
walking off the lot with a new 'vette for less than 60k USD.
1. Speed. Motorcycles provide similar-to-better performance to sports cars, at
least until we get into true supercar range, where traction advantages in cars
can overcome the weight advantages that bikes enjoy. Once more,
[Hayabusa](https://www.zeroto60times.com/vehicle-make/suzuki-motorcycles-0-60-mph-times/fast-slow-0-60/?region%5B%5D=Domestic#accordion-48570)
vs
[Corvette](https://www.zeroto60times.com/vehicle-make/chevrolet-0-60-mph-times/fast-slow-0-60/?yearMin=2014&yearMax=2022&bodyStyle%5B%5D=16752&bodyStyle%5B%5D=119#accordion-47541).
1. Control and engagement. The actual speed and performance of a sports vehicle
is not all *that* important[^3]; it's really about how fun they are to
operate. Motorcycles, being less shielded from the environment than cars,
generally provide a greater sensation of speed than a car moving at a similar
pace, a point in their favor. Then there's the fact that motorsports isn't just
about experiencing speed and acceleration (certain roller coasters would
completely outcompete it were that so), it's about controlling that speed and
acceleration. This the core reason why it is sacriligeous to install an automatic
transmission in a sports car[^4]. So where in a transit context it was a serious
disadvantage that going from a car to a motorcycle is like going from an
automatic to a manual transmission five times over, in the context of a
motorsport toy it is a tremendous advantage.

And then areas of disadvantage:

1. Safety. Even if we remove visibility concerns by operating on a track instead
of a normal road, bikes are still fundamentally more dangerous than cars because
they are more challenging to operate and because they are less shielded. You
might technically be able to flip your porsche, but even if you do, there's
still a roll cage protecting you.  Meanwhile, it's trivial to through yourself
off a bike, and the only thing protecting you at that point is whatever gear
you've got strapped on.

### Verdict

In sum, a sportsbike can provide similar or better real performance than a
sportscar at a much lower price point, and its perceived performance should only
amplify the gap. Assuming you are comfortable with high-risk behavior, and are
willing to/interested in making the (not insignificant) investments necessary to
engage in motorsports, motorcycles are a natural platform to choose.

[^1]: It's for the worse, but that's a topic for another time.
[^2]: Motorcycles are involved in off-road motorsports as well, but we're going
    to focus on track sports.
[^3]: Unless you are a professional racer, or your goal is simply to brag about
    your fancy car to the people you're with. If the former, your choice of
    vehicle has already been made. If the latter, we strongly advise looking for
    a more interesting crowd to associate with and/or being more interesting
    yourself.
[^4]: And why, in our opinion, extraordinary EV performance numbers such as
	those claimed by Tesla's roadster models are technically impressive but
	ultimately pointless.
