# Effective Meetings
A how-to for running meetings, especially recurring meetings, effectively,
inspired heavily by Urs Hoelzle's Google-internal good meetings manifesto.

## Defrag the Calendar
To oversimplify slightly, engineers don't get anything done outside of a flow
state. Meetings break flow, and it usually takes about a half an hour to
reestablish it. Each separate block of meetings on a calendar therefore carries
about a half-hour surcharge on top of the time already wasted^Wspent in the
meetings.

Take the time and effort to "play meeting tetris". It will pay for itself almost
immediately.

## Have an Agenda
Meetings are expensive; four people in a room for an hour costs a half a day
cumulatively even if we ignore any fragmentation effects. An explicit set of
goals for the meeting, ie an agenda, keeps discussion on priority topics and
stops people getting lost in the weeds. Knowing the agenda ahead of time also
discourages monopolization of the meeting by a few outgoing team members.

## Keep Minutes
Keep shared notes of what happened in a meeting. The shared written record will
help bring anybody who missed the meeting up to speed, and encourage shared
understanding by forcing the scribe to paraphrase any points made, and provide a
convenient point of reference for people that were able to attend the meeting.

A shared, running minutes document also provides a convenient place for
accumulating together an agenda before the meeting's next iteration.

## Skip the Status Updates
Don't hold meetings to go around the table and ask people what they've done for
the project in the last week. Written status updates, such as on bugs/tickets,
are faster to produce and consume, are more durable, don't break people's
concentration, and don't have to wait for a regularly scheduled meeting. Unless
you're looking for an excuse to get people face-to-face in a room this is a
waste of time.

## Stop when You're Done
Once you've addressed the agenda the meeting is done. Don't hang around
afterwards or stretch the topics to fill time; everybody's got work to do
outside of whatever you're currently discussing. If a meeting routinely runs
under consider paring down its time allotment, reducing its frequency, or
canceling it entirely.

Similarly, if nothing in the meeting requires your presence or helps you to do
your job, then you shouldn't be there. If people are doing a good job of writing
agendas in advance then you can make this determination a priori and avoid ever
breaking focus. If you're having trouble determining if you should or shouldn't
be in a meeting consider the following rule of thumb: if you're checking email
you should also be checking out.
